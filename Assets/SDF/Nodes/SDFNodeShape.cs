  /// This is a utility base class that can be used to create new types of shape nodes.
  /// 
  /// Shape nodes are leaf nodes in the signed distance hierarchy that generate a distance
  /// directly, and conceptually can represent shapes like spheres or boxes.
  /// 
  /// To create your own shape, you will need to extend this class and create a new shape
  /// 'operation'.  To create the new operation, you will want to create an inner struct
  /// that implements the IShapeOp interface contained within this SDFNodeShape class.  This
  /// operation struct is used as the generic parameter of SDFNodeShape.  This structuring 
  /// allows the base class to generate the instructions needed to execute the shape operation.
  /// 
  /// For an example of how to implement the SDFNodeShape class, you can take a look at Sphere.cs
